# Hammock — Brand & Identity Guide

## 1. Brand Essence

**Hammock** is a calm, human-centered space for people who love to read and think deeply.

It is not about books as objects, nor about productivity or speed. It is about the *state of mind* that reading enables:
- Slow thinking
- Long attention
- Comfort with complexity
- Staying with ideas instead of extracting them

Hammock is designed to feel like a place you return to, not a tool you rush through.

**Core idea:**
> Hammock is where readers stretch out with ideas.


## 2. Positioning

Hammock is a **Second Brain for Book Lovers**.

It combines:
- The emotional warmth of reading for pleasure
- The intellectual rigor of research and synthesis
- The calm confidence of a personal thinking space

It deliberately avoids:
- Explicit “AI” framing
- Productivity anxiety
- Literal book metaphors
- Technical or gimmicky branding


## 3. Brand Personality

Hammock should always feel:
- Calm
- Warm
- Thoughtful
- Unhurried
- Quietly confident

It should never feel:
- Loud
- Flashy
- Clever-for-the-sake-of-it
- Overly playful
- Aggressively technical


## 4. Logo Concept

### Primary Symbol: The Gentle Curve

The core visual mark of Hammock is a **single, soft, sagging curve**.

This curve intentionally carries multiple interpretations:
- A hammock
- A resting smile
- A pause
- A calm graph
- Tension held gently

The ambiguity is intentional and desirable.

**Design rules:**
- One curve only
- Rounded ends
- No sharp angles
- Generous whitespace
- Abstract, never literal


### Secondary Mark (Optional)

Two subtle anchor points with the curve can be used for icons or favicons:

•      •
  ⌢


## 5. Typography

### Direction

Use a **humanist sans-serif** that feels readable, warm, and serious.

Typography should communicate:
- Clarity
- Calm
- Trust

Avoid:
- Sharp geometric startup fonts
- Overly decorative or playful typefaces
- Cold, ultra-minimal tech fonts


### Wordmark Style

- Lowercase: **hammock**
- Relaxed letter spacing
- Medium or regular weight

Lowercase reinforces approachability and lack of ego.


## 6. Color Palette

### Base Colors

Choose one neutral base family:
- Linen / warm off-white
- Soft stone gray
- Light parchment tones


### Accent Color

Use **only one**, muted accent color, such as:
- Twilight blue
- Moss green
- Warm indigo
- Muted aubergine


**Rule:**
> Hammock should never be bright.

The overall feeling should resemble evening light or a quiet reading room.


## 7. App Icon Guidance

The app icon should:
- Use the curve mark
- Be minimal
- Have generous breathing room
- Feel calm and inviting

Do **not** use:
- Books or pages
- Worms
- AI symbols
- Chat bubbles
- Literal illustrations

The icon should feel like a place you want to return to.


## 8. Voice & Microcopy

Hammock’s voice is:
- Gentle
- Assured
- Reflective
- Unhurried

Example microcopy:
- “Take your time.”
- “What would you like to think about?”
- “Still thinking? That’s fine.”
- “Saved for later reflection.”

Avoid urgency, gamification, or optimization language.


## 9. Long-Term Brand Durability

Hammock is designed to age well because:
- It does not depend on trends or buzzwords
- It is emotion-first, not feature-first
- It scales naturally from personal reading to deep research

Ten years from now, Hammock should still comfortably mean:
> A place where serious readers feel at home.


## 10. Guiding Principle

If there is ever a design or product decision in doubt, ask:

> Does this make the user feel more relaxed, more thoughtful, and more willing to stay with ideas?

If the answer is yes, it belongs in Hammock.

## 11. UI Alignment Principles (Product & Layout)

Hammock’s interface should *physically express calm thinking*.

### Core UI Principles

1. **Space over density**  
   - Prefer whitespace over compactness  
   - Avoid filling every area with controls  
   - Let panels breathe

2. **Gentle transitions, never snaps**  
   - Panel resizing should feel like easing into rest  
   - Avoid sharp or sudden animations

3. **Few visible actions at a time**  
   - Reduce cognitive load by hiding secondary actions  
   - Reveal controls only when contextually relevant

4. **Vertical reading rhythm**  
   - Content should flow top-to-bottom like reading  
   - Avoid dense grids inside reading contexts


### Three-Panel Layout Guidance

**Library Panel**
- Feels like browsing shelves slowly
- Avoid aggressive filtering UI
- Prefer soft dropdowns and calm scroll

**Book Panel**
- This is the *center of gravity*
- Prioritize reading comfort over metadata density
- Sections should be collapsible, not stacked

**Chat Panel**
- Must feel conversational, not transactional
- Input area should feel like an invitation, not a command
- Avoid flashing cursors or urgent affordances


### Visual Rhythm

- Use consistent vertical spacing between sections
- Prefer rounded corners and soft dividers
- Avoid hard borders; use subtle contrast instead


## 12. Interaction & Motion Guidelines

Motion in Hammock should feel like **settling**, not navigating.

- Panel expansion should resemble stretching out
- Collapsing should feel like gently folding away
- Loading states should be calm and unobtrusive

Avoid:
- Bouncing
- Elastic overshoot
- Gamified motion


## 13. Microcopy & Language Guide

### Core Voice Traits

Hammock’s language should be:
- Calm
- Reassuring
- Thoughtful
- Non-judgmental

Avoid:
- Productivity language ("optimize", "crush", "boost")
- Urgency ("now", "quick", "don’t miss")
- Gamification ("streaks", "levels")


### Suggested Microcopy Patterns

**Empty States**
- “Nothing here yet. Take your time.”
- “Your reading life will grow here.”

**Chat Prompt**
- “What would you like to think about?”
- “Ask anything about your books.”

**Saving / Persistence**
- “Saved for later reflection.”
- “We’ll remember this.”

**Errors / Failures**
- “Something interrupted the thought. Try again when ready.”
- “That didn’t come through. No rush.”

**Navigation**
- “Back to your books.”
- “Continue reading.”


## 14. Decision Checkpoint

Before adding any new UI element, feature, or copy, validate it against these questions:

1. Does this slow the user down rather than speed them up?
2. Does this respect long attention?
3. Does this feel like a place to stay, not a task to finish?

If yes, it belongs in Hammock.

## 15. Final Logo Specifications (Locked)

### Logo Name
**Hammock — Modern Editorial H**

### Mark Description
A modern editorial **H** with a single curved crossbar that visually suggests a hammock.

- Serif or semi‑serif letterform
- Soft terminals, no sharp spikes
- Vertical strokes slightly heavier than the curved crossbar
- Crossbar sits *below the midpoint* of the H

The mark must read as an **H first**, and a hammock second.


### Geometry Rules
- One curved crossbar only
- Curve depth: deeper than a smile, shallower than a bowl
- Curve endpoints taper gently into vertical strokes
- No symmetry obsession; slight asymmetry is acceptable and human


### Clear Space
- Minimum clear space around the mark: height of the crossbar curve
- No UI elements, text, or borders may intrude into this space


### Minimum Size
- App icon: 24px (digital)
- Inline UI usage: 16px height minimum
- Below this size, use mark‑only (no wordmark)


## 16. Color Tokens (Brand)

### Primary Colors
- **Indigo / Twilight Blue** — primary brand background

## 21. Final Guardrail

Then it is **not Hammock**.
