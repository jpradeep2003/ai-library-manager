# Hammock — Brand Guide (Short)

This document defines the **non-negotiable brand principles** for Hammock.  
It exists to keep design, copy, and code aligned as the product evolves.

If something conflicts with this file, **this file wins**.

## What Hammock Is

**Hammock** is a calm, reader-centric application for people who love to read, think, and stay with ideas.

It is a *place*, not a productivity tool.

Hammock supports:
- Long attention
- Slow thinking
- Reflection and synthesis
- Comfort with complexity


## What Hammock Is Not

Hammock is **not**:
- A speed or productivity app
- A gamified reading tracker
- A flashy AI showcase
- A dense or noisy interface

Avoid urgency, optimization language, or feature-driven bravado.

---

## Brand Personality

Hammock should always feel:
- Calm
- Warm
- Thoughtful
- Unhurried
- Quietly confident

Hammock should never feel:
- Loud
- Clever-for-the-sake-of-it
- Trend-driven
- Aggressively technical

---

## Logo Usage

### Primary Mark
- Modern editorial **H** with a curved hammock crossbar
- Reads as **H first**, hammock second

### Rules
- Use the logo **only** in:
  - App icon
  - Top bar / header
  - Subtle empty-state watermark (optional)
- Do not repeat logos inside panels
- Do not stretch, skew, recolor, or decorate the logo
- No shadows, gradients, outlines, or effects

Authoritative assets live in `/branding`.

## Color & Typography

### Color
- Use calm, muted colors
- Prefer contrast over brightness
- Never use neon or saturated colors for branding

### Typography
- Logo: editorial serif or semi-serif (brand only)
- UI: humanist sans-serif

Do not mix logo typography into UI text.

---

## Voice & Microcopy

Hammock’s voice is:
- Gentle
- Human
- Reassuring
- Reflective

Avoid words like:
> optimize, boost, fast, now, streak, maximize

Prefer language that invites patience and thought.

Examples:
- “Take your time.”
- “What would you like to think about?”
- “Saved for later reflection.”

---

## Motion & Interaction

Motion should feel like **settling**, not navigating.

Rules:
- Slow, subtle transitions
- No bounce or elastic effects
- No celebratory or gamified animations

If motion draws attention to itself, it’s wrong.

---

## Design Decision Test

Before adding or changing anything, ask:

1. Does this slow the user down rather than speed them up?
2. Does this respect long attention?
3. Does this feel like a place to stay, not a task to finish?

If the answer to any is **no**, revise.

---

## Final Rule

When in doubt, choose:
> Less UI. More space. More calm.

That is Hammock.
